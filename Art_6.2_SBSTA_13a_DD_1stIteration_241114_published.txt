    I. Scope and definition of a cooperative approach
Option 1
                        1. Decides that a cooperative approach is the voluntary participation of a Party and/or  Parties incorporated with respect to cooperation, as mutually agreed, in implementing their nationally determined contributions and allow for  higher ambition in their mitigation and adaptation actions and to promote sustainable development and environmental integrity and to do the fairness transfer and use the internationally transferred mitigation outcomes that are consistent with requirements of relevance and a decision relating to the Article 6, paragraph 2;
Option 2
                        2. Recalls Article 6, paragraph 1, of the Paris agreement and decision 2/CMA.3 annex, paragraph 1 that a cooperative approach is:
                            (a) The voluntary participation of a Party or Parties in respect to an agreed scope, standards and procedures that involves the international transfer of mitigation outcomes authorized for use towards NDC or other international mitigation purposes;
                            (b) The relationship of the cooperative approach with any underlying mechanism(s) or framework(s) or approaches that are consistent with the relevant CMA decisions; 
                        3. [[Decides][Clarifies] that a cooperative approach for use towards the achievement of an NDC shall involve at least two participating Parties and that a cooperative approach for use for other international mitigation purposes shall involve at least one participating Party;
                        4. Decides that mitigation outcomes authorized for use towards the achievement of an NDC or other international mitigation purposes by a first transferring Party shall only be used or cancelled by a participating Party or an entity authorized by the Party participating in the cooperative approach;]
