Peer Stiansen - [7:33]
  
Colleagues, could you please find your seats And we'll start In a Minute. You we lack any Energy. Group, Everyone,

colleagues. Welcome to this third informal Consultation on substa agenda, Item 13 A, which is guidance on cooperative approaches, referred to in Article Six, paragraph two of the Paris Agreement, and in decision two CMA three, it seems we're not as fully as popular as yesterday, so hopefully most, if not all, can be in the room here. But there is also an overflow room and a possibility to follow us virtually, in case it's two full in in here, colleagues, Maria and I would like to thank you all again for your constructive engagement during the informal consultations yesterday, and your willingness and cooperation to advancing the consideration of the current draft text as agreed yesterday, we will keep these informal consultations open to observers unless the party objects. And also please remember that recording the session is not permitted, including with the AI note takers colleagues yesterday, we heard your views on the elements of the first cluster and started considering the second cluster on matters related to application of the first transfer the AF and tables for submitting annual information as part of the regular information. We mustn't forget the tables. So at the end of yesterday's informal consultations, we still had parties and groups that were on the speakers list to take the floor in relation to the second cluster. So I have the following on my list. It's the Arab group, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand and the LDCs. Bear in mind that this is not close list. So I see Turkey and CF ran as well. So without further ado, when the Arab group, wherever you are, you have the floor. Yeah, I see you down there.

#Paragraph 1.#:  Decides that a cooperative approach is the voluntary participation of a Party or Parties in applying guidance related to Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement, which includes implementing national arrangements concerning mitigation outcomes from authorized underlying mechanisms or frameworks and allows for the international transfer of those mitigation outcomes towards nationally determined contributions or other international mitigation purposes, ensuring alignment with underlying mechanisms and relevant CMA decisions, and that:
#Subparagraph (a)#:  A cooperative approach involving mitigation outcomes authorized by a first transferring Party for use towards the achievement of an NDC shall involve at least two Parties participating in that approach and that a cooperative approach for mitigation outcomes authorized for use for other international mitigation purposes shall involve at least one participating Party;

Thank you, Pierre Good morning colleagues, and thank you for giving us the floor. For the arrow group for Section three, application of first transfer, we see that there is no need for further guidance or on first transfer, as we already have read text on Glasgow from Glasgow. So our option here is no text option, option four or option 1b which reads the size that the first transfer pursue it to these 2, CMA, 3, Paras to A and B for section 4, agreed electronic format. We see that AEF is an enabler of agreed upon guidance, and we do not prefer to adopt such an elaborate draft of AEF without further text testing. So we we would like to continue work on the draft version of the AEF for Section B, actions to be reported, uh, again, uh, goes without saying option 2, so no text. And for Section 5, tables submit, for submitting annual information as part of the regular information, we see that option 2 fits purpose For tables and for sequencing, for sequencing and timing, or yeah, I'll stop here fine,

thank you, Bill as a copactor, good morning. Colleague, regarding the first transfer application, we choose option three according to our previous intervention, because we still need a clear elaboration regarding decision two. CMP three on Anna, para 2b however, we can compromise between option 2 or option 3 as a single option, or a combination between option 2 and option 3. Regarding a grid electronic format. We can support the previous intervention that agreed electronic be adopted. So we choose option 1. as for action to be reported in the agreed electronic format We choose option 2 with no text requirement, because it has clearly been defined on table agreed rental format. Thank you very much.

You and good morning all. It's lovely to be back here, well rested and also in a room that doesn't have the strange audio qualities of last night's room I want. On first transfer I will focus my comments on paragraph 31 but just to note that we see option 1, as I think we've heard from some others, as not adding hopefully to decisions already made, and then on option 2, we we don't see para 29 as adding anything to decisions already made as well, so that that seems to us superfluous. So these are places that are ripe for streamlining, as we see it. And we heard some discussion on why that would be the case in paragraph 29 last night. on paragraph 31 so this is under other first transfer specifications. It's part B, the paragraph on OIMG, which is paragraph 31 is quite complicated and doesn't actually as it's drafted, managed to clarify things. So we we spend a bit of time trying to understand what what the intent was here, and if we've understood it correctly, think that it can be simplified quite significantly without compromising its intent to say something like "each first transferring, participating party shall apply the specification of first transfer in an Authorization for Use, for consistently for that authorization of ITMOs from a cooperative approach". So it gives effect to the application of a specification, and it requires it to be done consistently, and clarifies that the specification of first transfer may differ for each authorization. And with that wording, I think we could, we don't need the reference to respective authorization types, and we can avoid the sort of references to different authorization types throughout this so happy to share that in writing, but hope that that is a path to simplification there on the agreed electronic format and regular information as critical pieces of our transparency provisions in Article 6, we want to see the AEF and tables for reporting regular information adopted here at COP 29 this work has been substantially delayed so far, and it is really important for us to resolve it this year, there is some substantial work required in the case of the AEF, to clean up the format, And we appreciate the intervention from Japan, which indicated bracketed areas which may be streamlined. Thank you.

Good morning, Mr. Co facilitator, and this is not a joke, but my flag is once again missing, so with the Secretariat's help, I hope to find it again. So on first transfer, we consider that much of this text that we really developed in Dubai is useful, and consider it relatively stable. Oh, thank you Gaye so much. Yay. Thank you. Thank you. Relatively stable text that we have that we're working with, except perhaps paragraphs 25 and 26 which we've heard others mentioned as well as not particularly useful and a bit inconsistent with existing guidance, and we haven't heard any calls for their retention. So my request that these get removed for shoe mining purposes. We would support the intervention made by the European Union last night, that new text for the clarification that first transfers would need to be affected within the NDC implementation period, we would support this, especially where the definition of a first transfer is cancelation or use, parties should not be surprised with the need to undertake a corresponding adjustment ever, but especially not once the implementation period has concluded. For the same reason, we would therefore also support paragraph 30 for the notification of cancelation or use for parties to facilitate this communication and timely accounting. Similarly, we do not see that this Text in Paragraph 30, which is noted as option 3, is mutually exclusive to option 2 above, and would suggest that perhaps these two could be merged so that first transfer is triggered for the earlier of the first international transfer, or the to be definition and where the to be option may require guidance on the paragraph 30 to notify the cancelation or use. Hopefully, that makes sense. We're also supportive of paragraph 31 on ensuring that first transfers are defined and applied consistently within a cooperative approach. We support the all of these paragraphs, as I noted, but also acknowledge that they may benefit from improvements in drafting so we're not sort of endorsing them as written, just the concepts within and would highlight, for example, the US is concerned on noting to noting references to ITMOs in the first transfer paragraphs where ITMOs are not yet ITMOs, given that they have not yet been first transferred. And then we would, we would particularly like to work further on the paragraphs pertaining to first transfers for the adaptation fund and for OMG. As we don't think these are fully implementable as currently drafted, but would support AOSIS and wanting these to work. And then finally, we absolutely support the adoption of the AEF, but feel there is quite a bit of work to do to clean up, particularly the Actions list, given this tool allows for consistency checks for largely quantitative information. I'm just not convinced that this entire list of actions facilitates this. And I would also recall that the international registry is intended to help populate the AF, and therefore the consistency between these would be required, and currently we do not see that. I'll leave it there. Thank you.

thank you very much. Chair. Pleasure to be here on further guidance on first transfer for we we see that there are some bridging proposals floating around, and we're in consultations with other parties, so we will engage in that discussion on on other first transfer specific specification. We, like ers, think that paragraph 32 and 33 are important, and that they should be because they relate to share proceeds and overall mitigation and global emissions. And certainly we'd like to keep those paragraphs and continue working on those, on agreed electronic format, particularly on the actions to be reported. We would like to keep this list at the moment, inevitably, a lot of this information will end up in the AF, but for the purposes of ensuring the detail of the information we would like to see in the AF, we'd like to keep this option one here as it stands, until we're satisfied that the AF represents the issues that we're we're comfortable with, um on tables for submitting Annual Information. I suspect that these options are likely to end up in a procedural decision, adopting the tables, but we need to see the tables first before we develop such a procedural decision.

morning. Thank you for application of first transfer. We support option two regarding the application of first transfer, paragraph 28 is suitable for us, but in paragraph 29 conditions A and B should apply to the case of the first transfer of ITMO authorized for both NDC and o rather than those authorized only for OIM. Therefore these conditions in paragraph 29 should be used to clarify paragraph 20 8b for other first transfer specifications. We don't believe additional specifications are needed for EF Section B under authorization action the bracket should be removed for change and revocation regarding tables for submitting Annual Information, we are comfortable with option one, thank you.

Good morning here. Good morning colleagues would be last will be also quick. So an application of first transfer, as New Zealand said, we also, we didn't hear supports for the option 825, and 26 so it's giving you probably opportunity to streamline the text here and delete those part option option B is that where we see reflected our views. Also we received text that party are working on, and we see that definitely in our view, I reflect, and we're happy to work on those like raised by others on para 28 we cannot talk about in international transfer mitigation outcome until their transfer. So with some changes, we see they already mentioned by some other parties. We see this to be working on paragraph 29 on a what is that the first international transfer, or international transfer mitigation outcome to another party or entity, we would like to see added here para 30 again, we don't see can work synergistically with 29 so we don't we don't see them opposite. So with some streamline as well, we believe that should be retained as well on other first transfer specifications, like mentioned by others, I believe we agree with the content, but there is need for streamline. And we also heard the European Union add some text on that to streamline. So happy to work on that. On the grid, electronic format, option, we are okay to go with option one, as long as we make meaningful progress. So at the moment, we would like to see option one and option three retained action to be reported on the grid, electronic format, like others, we would like option one to be retained as well, to help guide us our work and lastly, on Section five, again, option one, but at the moment, we would like to Keep option three to see how we move along in this section. And then probably we will go based on the old text with option one, but we need to see option three at the moment based on how we progress. Then thank you so much.

Thank you better and one more speaker on the list. Actually, I didn't see your flag. It's the EIG flag. I believe Simon. And then I also hear that China, China's flag is up so EIG, please.

I can confirm that China's flag is helpful from here. Thank you so much, pair, and thank you colleagues for the very good discussion on this, on this topic, we are making progress, I think, and we have also seen very helpful suggestions shared inform me in textual form by some parties that can be integrated here. Just recalling also from our end, I think we haven't heard support for option a limited value added. Then in regard to So, I think that could be taken out crucially in option B, as others have highlighted in paragraph 28 we would really need to see that slash or to be taken out, because only if it's the two cases, there's a need for clarification, because then there is a sequence issue, and we have to provide that guidance when it's just one of those cases. You just run with the process as is already defined in our Glasgow text, we note option two and option two and option three are not mutually exclusive. So 28 can very much be combined with paragraph 30. And we're also happy to work further on the, you know, other first transfer specifications to make sure that the the concerns raised here to allow for transfers to the adaptation fund and cancelations can be made in an orderly manner. We note that a lot of work over many years has gone into the AF, and we are at a very far and pretty mature stage with, in our view, minimal editing that is further needed, and we are confident that 34 the adoption of the AF here, can be the outcome. Equally final point on the regular information, we also support paragraph 39 and hope that the tables contained in the Anna x will be able to adopt it. Look forward to getting there. Thank you.

please. Thank you here. My information will be brief. We generally support point made by rmdc and then many other parties we here. We only want to seek a bit clarification coming to the discussion here is and maybe advice to streamline our text. It's on the application of the first transfer and option two. We also joined the view that, as we have already have the phrase like n slash, all in paragraph 28 to define different type of the authorization tabs of the units ITMOs. We we don't see the added value of the paragraph 29 so maybe we could simplify that. Thank you.

Thank you. And that concluded. My list of speakers for this cluster, and I appreciate the attitude of the room. I mean, it seems that you're trying to come together and that you're definitely trying to at least slim the paper so that there are as few pieces with options as possible. Clearly, there is a scope, I think, for discussions, also outside of the room, to get some of these fairly technical things in as good shape as we can. And we would certainly appreciate that. I'm thinking about getting, for example, the things related to MJ and SOP, right? It's fairly, fairly technical part of that, and also getting the tables right, so that we can get as far as we we can get during this session. And it's, yeah, it is still substance and a short, short session. So so that there is pressure on doing that quite, quite fast. So on that I'd like to to pass over to to Maria for for the next cluster, please, Maria.

Very much, Pierre and I allow me to say, Good morning everyone. And just to build on what my fellow co facilitator just highlighted, the spirit in the room is very nice. It's extremely positive, and we can see that everyone is trying to work towards solutions. But I want to give you a peek behind the curtain a little bit with your indulgence. Today is Wednesday. The only time that has been slotted for the discussions of Article 6.2 is the next two hours and 20 minutes we need to finish discussing the remaining sections of the entirety of this text in order for us to be able to turn text for you to consider by tomorrow, in order for you to engage in the streamlined text that you're all asking for, and then hopefully given the time to consider it Tomorrow and discuss, we may be able to turn a second iteration for your consideration to close the session on Saturday. Right, we only have two more days. If we don't finish the sections today, we will not be able to turn the text tonight, which means we will be losing all of tomorrow. I urge you to take this into consideration as we move forward, and try to keep your interventions nice and short and crisp and targeted towards what the next iteration that you will hopefully receive sometime early tomorrow looks like to facilitate further discussions, right? We know each other's positions at this point in time. I'm sure everyone is quite familiar, so tell us what's new. Make it brief, make it short, and we'll just clip right on for the next two hours and a half so we can get the show on the road. So with your indulgence, we turn now to the third cluster on matters related to sequencing and timing, process of identifying, notifying and correcting inconsistencies and inconsistencies identified and Article Six, technical expert reviews and special circumstances of the least developed countries and small island developing states. These are sections 678, and nine. So colleagues, the floor is open. Uk, thank you.

On inconsistencies, we must provide clear guidance on the processes around them, and we have been working on a refined version of these options and circulating these with other parties and groups. And to summarize here on the floor, the concepts we've been including are one that information is submitted before the technical expert review report has been published. That this will still undergo the quantitative consistency check, but the output will be marked with the notation Article Six, technical expert review report pending, and that the outputs will include notations to make clear the status of other reporting and review processes. We feel that this concept has been well socialized in the room and is pretty stable. Two how consistencies from the quantitative consistency check, the completeness check and the other inconsistencies from the technical expert review will be identified. And this identify and identification being through the outputs being publicly displayed and tagged, including through user friendly table. Again, here, we've heard references to these many times, so we hope that's stable three defining what consistent, what a persistent inconsistency would be, and significant inconsistencies. Here, the challenge has been how we can send a signal of what significant inconsistencies are without prejudging or removing the ability for the technical expert reviewers to also define something as significant. We've therefore been working on some text to provide some indication of what significant may be, but which would not prejudge or prevent the technical expert reviewers from providing more detail on what significant would be. And finally, we have had some convergence on the significant inconsistency being an inconsistency that has an impact on double pounding and corresponding adjustments. And we will share this with any other interested parties and groups, and we'll be working with others to hopefully provide this as a consolidated option that we can all work on. And to close, we remain committed to securing an outcome on Article Six, and we hope this will help with those efforts. Thanks.

I'm done. Oh, I'm on. Thanks very much. And I am also conscious of time and grateful for the UK for their proposals. We also have proposals in this area on the table, which I think would deliver a significant streamlining. As you know, we've been one of the parties that has had a rather tough review on sequencing in the section on sequencing, but we've indicated flexibility. Should there be more upfront transparency between the processes in 44 and 46 as outlined there, it's very important to us that we know what we're getting into at the earliest possible stage and upfront transparency would give us more flexibility with regard to the choices on sequencing. 47 is something that we don't think is useful. We would keep paragraph 48 and 49 I think, is misplaced. We would perhaps place this in the section on remediation of inconsistencies, rather than in sequencing turning to inconsistencies. I think, like others, we are keen that inconsistencies are flagged on the carp, inconsistencies all types, whether they're found in the Secretariat check or the Article Six experts review. We do think that the inconsistencies can be graded, but we're also focused on the questions of significant and persistent. We do think that significant certainly includes double counting risks, but I think we would extend it to a range of inconsistencies for which we have a proposal circulating. We also note that paragraphs 24 and 25 from Sharm annex two gives us a timing for the resolution of inconsistencies, one within the review and one by the next reported information. And we think that that's the basis for defining what is persistent and a finding of persistency, where there is a significant and persistent inconsistency. And there are various reporting consequences we feel, and we've outlined them also in a proposal. The simple ones are outlining this in the Article Six terror report and notification to the CMA for their awareness, public notice to parties and authorized participants participating in the cooperative approach. We also think that annual information that has been submitted where there are inconsistencies resolved, there should be a consequence that further reports involving inconsistency should not be processed until the former inconsistencies have been resolved, we have consequences in terms of the finding of significant inconsistency with reference to the Compliance Committee, we do think that we could remind parties that they are not to use ITMOs where there are, where there's an inconsistency towards its achievement of its NDC, and a reminder that corresponding adjustments that are done on the basis of ITMOs should also not happen. We've got text on that are interested in engaging with parties on how we might ensure that we don't perpetuate inconsistencies in the system and complicate the review process for article 13, I think that's it.

Thank you, Maria. Well, on sequencing and timing a, we found that on option A, A to para 44 there, there is some kind of misunderstanding as well, and this depends on what the cooperative approach is or not a so the information can be at the ITMO level or the cooperative approach level, which is why option eight, we find it a little bit out of place or misplacing or just judging a response, but we think that option B and C can be mixed together a, and that's something that that we have also been working on in our proposal, that we have also circulated around. And I can say that we have also we have also had the EU a option, and we are right now seeing if there can be some kind of combination as well with the EU proposal on this, on the next, which is the section, or other impacts due to inconsistencies on ITMOs. We agree with the EU that the Para 49 can be placed somewhere else, rather than here. And we also see that para 48 it's a part, an important part of the process on the next section, sorry. Can Can you clarify to us if the next one the next section process of identifying, notifying and correcting inconsistencies, if we are also talking about that? Thank you. So on that section A, we want to highlight that we see that options in option one, option A and B are also not mutually exclusive, so they can be mixed together. And that's also in our proposal, we would like to highlight specifically some issues that we see in option A, which is that not necessarily the consistency check can be done if it's just one participating party, unless you have another place in which you have the same information to do the consistency check. So the consistency check could also only be done if it's between parties. So we see here that there could be some issues if we leave a participating party or between participating parties? Yeah, I think that will be all about that section. Maybe we have also some comments on option b2 which is about the timing of certain steps that are sequenced here, like a double I am an option to we also see that there are many misinterpretations in the way that it is placed, The A phrasing and also a sorry again. Are we checking also the inconsistencies identified by expert reverse? Or are we going to be a speaking on this later on? Can you clarify that to us as well? Because it was not clear at the beginning how many sections we were commenting on Ida.

We are going all the way to Section 9. Okay, thank you. And then on the next section on inconsistencies identified by the reviewers A, we also find that a lot of things put through option one A will be AILAC position view, and we don't want to go through it, but a we see that we could work together with other parties on selecting some of these issues, and they can be also streamlined a and and also on the option of identification of inconsistencies as the UK mentioned, we also found that significant inconsistencies could be problematic, specifically in case that there could be some inconsistencies that are significant, at some that are not, and then later, all The later on, they could also be found significant, and also it could maybe bring less importance to some inconsistencies when all inconsistencies should be important. And on this section, we also have a proposal mixing some of the implications between a the different sections and yeah, now going into the next section. Sorry for taking so long, because this section is also quite long A, and on Section 9 A, we also feel comfortable with option 1, but we would like to hear the views of the parties that put through option two of the special circumstances. And yeah, that will be all. Thank you.

Thank you and good morning colleagues, we will just address the principles based on the fact that we can work with the options and are ready with colleagues to see how we can merge certain options that are on the table. But just to recall that all the credibility of this approach, this mechanism, Article Six, is based on the fact that we need to ensure that we avoid double counting, as well as all the participating party and cooperation FOLLOW the guidance we have set up, and that can be only done through the review to ensure that they have follow that. It's why it's very important that for us, that the report of the review been of the initial report, been published before the submission or the the the the use under the cap of the annual report, as well as The regular report, and also, if the initial report is submitted at the same time, then the regular report, because the end the BTR, because it's on one option, I think we need also just to address first the initial report, publish the result of that before addressing the other elements, whether the it's the AF or the regular reports, in principle, and based now on the consistency check done by the Secretariat, as well As the consistency review of the technical expert review, we agree with colleagues that have highlighted, and it's already in the text that we need to clearly define what we consider as significant and consistency, persistent and consistency, mineral and consistency, and all of that need to be defined, and all of them needed to be clearly flagged in the carport, about the different reports that are submitted. And based on that, the consequence of that, if there are significant inconsistency that can undermine the integrity of that corporation, we consider that We have different type of consequence that can happen, including stopping the transfer of the mitigation outcome that can go until at that point in my point of view, because, as I said, and also there is both in The quality of the inconsistency and the significant and consistency, as well as in the quantity of ITMO transfer, for example, a country can say in its report that they have used 1000 units coming from Senegal. And the report of Senegal said, I have only transferred 8000 we need to address that issue, and the second reports needs to be blocked until that inconsistency been resolved. There are some issues like that that we need to ensure the credibility of the mechanism, in principle, but there are many options and proposal that can address some of the issues, but we need to reorganize it in a way that will come from the initial report, the near the AF, the regular report and the review that will happen, and what can happen during those ones, and what will be the consequence of that.

 Thank you. I'm speaking on behalf of coopersu members Brazil Uruguay and Paraguay on sequencing and timing option one is preferable. We understand that different layers of reporting and reviewing are there for a reason. And if we lack and the lack of transparency does not entail, if the lack of transparency does not entail any consequence, then the process is meaningless. In this period, we understand that paragraph 46 is particularly important, since it conveys the notion that consistency of one step must be achieved prior to moving forward. The question here is whether the next step is the authorization of the emails or the submission of the annual information through the AF and regular info, since the Annual Information, according to paragraph 20 a of the RMPs deals with the authorizations of ITMOs, it's logical that the authorization of specific ITMOs is already covered, which should only be taken once consistency is insured, first transfer should only be happening Once consistencies fully insured. On paragraphs 48 and 49 we understand that real, verified and additional are the very attributes of an ITMO. So verification is a scenic one, on condition for its material existence, some types of inconsistencies could challenge the very, very capability of the ITMO. So halting its transfer makes sense and add security to the system as a whole. On the process of identifying, notifying and correcting inconsistencies, option B is preferable for us for a higher degree of transparency and within the scope, option b1 seems to leave more room for the discretion of reviewers in future decisions by not specifying the possibilities involving consistencies, whereas b2 seems to be more precise. So the task here will be to assess what are we striving for, and at this juncture, considering there will be a learning curve, we would prefer to leave more room for the reviewers to identify inconsistencies and unforeseen circumstances on inconsistencies identified by the church reviews. Paragraphs 54 to 56 in our view, it's a part of implementing the sham guidance of review. Paragraphs 57 to 58 in our perception, the only way to assess whether the requirements in 18 h2 about environmental integrity are consistently covered by information provided in the initial report. Thus, of course, ensuring that information is complete, transparent and consistent with the relevant RMP is through considering the methodological approaches used in the cooperative initiative. So it's important to have it there. Paragraph 64 we understand that enabling the reviewers to ensure transparency at the level expected by the outside world would require specific actions involving certain types of inconsistencies. It's also important to identify more clearly what we mean by significant inconsistencies, and giving the reviewers some tools to do so seems to be important. We understand that taking this step would represent an important achievement in terms of protecting the environmental integrity and allowing transactions to go on in spite of perceived inconsistencies, especially if their significance seems contrary to this period of ensuring a maximum integrity set of rules in cooperative approaches. And in our view, this is not being punitive. Alternatively, the impediments suggested could be adjusted to reflect recommendations by the third on paragraph, we understand that option one paragraph 67 seems to strengthen the notion, and with that intent, we favor option A, establishing a liaison with the pike in cases of inconsistencies, particularly, of course, the significant and persistent ones. Basically for us, this is ensuring transparency in Article 6.2 so I'll stop here. Thanks.

Geoffrey Brouwer - [56:04]
  
Thank you very much. And good morning everyone. Thanks for the opportunity for Yeah, the opportunity to be able to engage on this text, and in our view, this, this specific section, particularly chapters six, seven and eight on sequencing inconsistencies, needs significant overhaul, just in its organization. So I think there's a way, I think that we can organize this text that will be significantly more streamlined without losing options. In our view, large sections of this text confuse the two different what are called inconsistencies, or consistency processes that we think can be again, better organized. So just to clarify this and provide a few examples of areas where we think this could be improved, and I'm sure there's others as well that I haven't caught but on specifically chapter seven, the process for identifying and correcting inconsistencies. It would almost be useful to add to this header that this section pertains to, identifying, notifying, correcting inconsistencies from the automated consistency check procedure. There are sections here, particularly, I think option b2 paragraph 52 that refers to the technical expert review process of regular information and initial report, which again, would not belong here, but in the following section seven, which again pertains specifically to inconsistencies in The review process. I know our terminology is confusing sometimes, but again, I think there's ways that we can significantly improve this. This language, just as another example under sequencing and timing, there's a reference in paragraph 43 which refers to the labeling of information, of annual information with notation keys of the status of the review report. That same proposal is captured in chapter seven under paragraphs. I think it's even mislabeled paragraphs, but paragraphs two and three under paragraph 66 I think they're meant to be paragraph 6768 but again, there's a number of areas where there's some duplication. And again, not removing options, but simplifying this text, I think could be a significant improvement in a new iteration. So again, apologies for that length introduction, but I did want to dive into a few specific sections to capture some of our views as well. Specifically, the section on sequencing. I think what we what we want to see here is clarity around the status of the review. So again, Canada supports paragraph 43 it's concept, but we think it's actually better represented in the paragraph that I mentioned under paragraph 66 two and three, again, labeling annual information with the status of the review. So just to provide our support for that concept, paragraphs, in our view, paragraphs 44 this is clarifying information. We think it's it's somewhat helpful. Same with, yeah. So paragraph 44 we find, is helpful, however, paragraphs 45 and 46 in our view, are contradictory to existing guidance that we already have. We've heard other parties provide support for these paragraphs, but in our view, we see these as contradictory. So, for example, paragraph 45 option B states that the report on the initial report review shall be published prior to the parties, including annual information from that cooperative approach, we know that parties can submit these reports in conjunction with one another. So again, this is contradictory to guidance that we've adopted in Sharm. And in our view, again, the brackets make it somewhat confusing, but paragraph 46 option C, is also contradictory to existing information we've already agreed to, or existing guidance that we've agreed to, the idea that the updated initial report has to be finalized again before the authorization doesn't make any sense. We know authorization is the trigger for the initial report. So I think a number of these paragraphs, in our view, should be deleted as they're contradictory. In the same vein, we also see contradiction of paragraph 47 with existing guidance that we have. Paragraph 47 encourages parties to submit an initial report prior to submitting an agreed electronic format. Again, this is a prerequisite for submitting the agreed electronic format, and find that this paragraph could also be deleted. Turning to the next section, chapter seven, process of identifying correcting inconsistencies, again from the automated consistency check procedure, there is some again, overlap and duplication here, option the two again refers to regular information and the initial report again that that should best fit in Section seven, Not in sorry, Section Eight, not in Section seven. So but again, we do support the labeling of data in the carp of the results and the on the basis of the outcome of the automated consistency check procedure. And we see this as best being captured in option, I believe, b1 so I think this, this section could be significantly pared down. Finally, on the section eight, pertaining to inconsistencies in the technical expert review process. From from our perspective, option one paragraph, 54 to 57 largely are, I think, all recalling existing information we already have and question that their value. We see paragraph 58 this comparing of methodological approaches to the CDM as being entirely inappropriate and has no basis in this text. So a little bit surprised to see this still in our text, and similar with paragraph 60 and 61 referring to certain convention guidance on REDD. Plus we also don't see as fitting here in our text below that, I think there are again several helpful proposals that Canada would support around the labeling of specific types of inconsistencies. Again, supporting further below option. Again, these options are a little bit confusing, but on page 14, paragraph 66 and the following paragraph two and three, we support. There are a number of terms that are introduced in this this text that are new, new concepts. And I think in general, we should all try to avoid introduction of new terms. So in paragraph 64 we introduced the term formal inconsistencies, data inconsistencies, material inconsistencies. We have agreed to the term significant and persistent. And I think the addition of additional terms here isn't particularly helpful, and would would prefer to avoid and to see the these these pieces removed, but pertaining to the definition of significant and persistent, I think we've had a really interesting discussion on this at the workshop last month, and is willing to engage with parties on how we define this. And just wanted to point to the fact that the article 13 so the transparency process that we have under the Paris Agreement, also uses the term significant and persistent. The article 13 process ultimately left the definition of these terms up to the lead reviewers, and I think that's an option that we think is should be retained in the text. I believe that's paragraph 69 but I think we have another option of whether we as CMA or the substa can actually define these terms ourselves. Canada is open to engaging in these discussions. I believe there's been some interesting proposals put forward around the definition of significant pertaining to issues of double counting and persistent, again, as defined in paragraph 60 3b as remaining unresolved by the time of the second or subsequent review. So I think these are helpful concepts, and look forward to engaging further in them again, apologies for the lengthy intervention, but I think this, these three chapters in particular, could could benefit from a significant reorganization and streamlining. Thank you.

Thank you, Canada, Pakistan. 

Thank you being mindful of the time constraints, we shall not be going over the options that we have already discussed and aligned with at Vaughan, but a few quick points for consideration on the items under discussion right now. We hope that whichever option is decided for sequencing and reporting does not place a reporting burden on developing countries which have limited capacity and resources, some flexibility in the sequencing and timing of reporting could allow for greater transparency of the overall process by allowing the parties to update information as it becomes available. And on the issue of addressing inconsistencies, Pakistan agrees with the African group, the LMDC, and other parties, that the nature of these inconsistencies be clearly identified in the technical expert review process as the this nature of inconsistencies and how these are interpreted, would eventually impact market competitiveness. We also hope to hear from other parties and see the iterated text on the issues of inconsistencies, especially in terms of the fate of the mitigation outcomes that are deemed inconsistent and they use towards NDCs achievement. Thank

thank you very much. With respect to, I'll be quite brief, with respect to sequencing, in our view, there shouldn't be population of the AF table before the initial report has been reviewed. So we see ourselves in paragraph 46 option 1c that the review the initial report will be completed before the submission of the AEF. With respect to that information. Yes, as AILAC has mentioned, there's probably some room for linking with paragraph 45 it's been mentioned that somehow that's inconsistent with our rules. We don't think so. We appreciate that. You know, concerns have been raised that we have an agreed delivery date requirement for the EF but we think that can, that can be managed with respect to inconsistencies. Like others have said, we see a need for reorganization of the text. I think it'll be easier even to comment on the text when it's reorganized. We do appreciate a system for addressing gradations of issues. With respect to paragraph 52 I just want to point out that here the content of b2 we appreciate we appreciate the clarity and the reference to the different the different reports that are being reviewed, we see the need to address inconsistencies in each report, and not just on quantitative information, but also on qualitative information, where that's been sought, through the guidelines for reporting in connection with these different reports, paragraph 62 and 63 that address the identification of inconsistencies here. You know that we appreciate the definition of significant and persistent. These are terms we need to sort out. We're okay with the definitions here, but we need to think about the different reports. For example, in 60 3b Can we leave inconsistencies unresolved for two years in connection with a BTR? I mean, we think, we think not persistence, really the shortest time possible. So if there's still a problem persisting after a review that's already persistent and should be flagged as such until fixed on implications of inconsistencies and non responsiveness. We need consequences. So we we see proposed restrictions on the use of ITMOs toward NDCs, etc, if they're inconsistencies that are unresolved related to those ITMOs, that's just that seems sensible. And with respect to the pike and inconsistencies, we need a clear link between inconsistencies and the pike and more language is probably needed on this than we have in power 62 and 68 so that the link is quite, quite clear.

thank you, Madam Chair, on sequencing and timing, we've seen some proposals floating around from the UK, and we'd also think that this, the framing of this by AILAC, seems quite sensible, and therefore we'd like to work with AILAC on some of those issues, on the review of inconsistency. Our position has to to been to ensure environmental integrity and transparency. So we want to support all the options that give us that comfort. And I think the EU is proposal around this issue seems to draw a lot of that those concepts together. So where we would like to work with the EU on some of those on on the process of identifying, notifying and correspond, correcting inconsistencies, like others, we think the detail provided in b2 is useful, and I think we'd like that retained on the review of practice guidance, again, option one gives us the necessary detail, and we'd like to see that retained. There is other work going around in some of those issues, like on the implications of non responsiveness. We're not sure if options A and B work, but we clearly need to see the connection to the pike asis has indicated, and we need to develop some language around that. Finally, on the the issue of special circumstances, of LDCs and SIDS, I don't think we've heard any objections to this language, and we'd like to keep option one, preferably however, we think that at some stage we need to give some definition of what that really means, and that may be some sort of cover decision that will go with this to establish some sort of process of capacity building for LDCs. So rather than just recognition of the LDCs, we have to establish a process to implement that recognition. And we think a cover decision that gives some direction towards some capacity building would be useful. Thank you.

Thank you, Maria. Let me first say in general, that we believe this session is one of the most important of the overall text that we're discussing here that is going what is going to be transparent, transparency and allow to create an environment mechanism with environmental integrity. So in our view, in these sections, whatever there is more clarity, and whatever options where there is additional text that we see our way forward, going briefly on the sections, on section, and also to say that we'll be receiving text from other parties, the first one from the UK, where we feel many of their options are considered and work with. We received also from AILAC and EU a little bit later, and we're still going through that, but we found that there is some text that we can align as well with that. So happy to continue to work with party on these, with these three texts, and probably try to consolidate on sequencing and timing. Option six, we see clearly our views reflected on option one, particularly option C, paragraph, 46 but also a mix program 44 and 46 on moving on, process of identifying and notifying, on correction of inconsistency. Like others, we see a review reflect on option V in particularly in option b2 where more specification is provided, and like OSS mentioned as well, we see these should be considered both qualitative and quantitative as well as we move on, inconsistency identified by the technical expert review. We saw a option. One is where we see ourself. We saw text where try to provide some guidance about why living flexibility as the UK was allowed, but still trying to provide guidance flexibility to the reviewers, and we're really happy to work, to continue to work in this text, one element that we support, and we heard from other parties as well, that when there are significant inconsistency, the transfer should not be happen, and we clearly, we strongly support these then as we Move In paragraph 64 where we recognize significant inconsistency, clearly, there are some like one double counting that could be identified, but again, allow the reviewers with some flexibility. But we see also like inconsistency with all the decision to CMA three, annex and paragraph one could be defined as a significant and considering also that has to be emissions reductions and removals. And you know, avoidance is included, is excluded, so that should be captured as a significant inconsistence. Compar, paragraph. As we move into the identification and inconsistency, we see a view reflected on paragraph 66 and lastly, on implication of not response analysis, we see option one, and in particularly option A, as also suggested by group posture, where the Paris compliance implementation Compliance Committee could be called into two actions in this case, but Again, looking forward to continuing to work with the tax adjusted by the UK, the EU and also AILAC in some response. Thank you.

thank you, Madam COVID solicitor, for giving me the floor. We first would like to start by supporting the the sentiment that was expressed by our colleague from Pakistan, that this should not overburden parties, especially developing country parties, and their views expressed regarding allowing parties to update the information as it becomes available. And we do support many parties that express that. The spirit of this section is to maintain environmental integrity and avoid double counting, and we also support that upfront transparency is essential. However, upfront transparency should not stop further transparency along the reporting of the cooperations in place, specifically when stopping the reporting of the animal information. So for sequencing, our preference is option three, and we remain open to engage with other parties on their proposals to resolve our shared concerns, given that we do not qui contradict existing guidance, and we also appreciate the sentiment expressed of not attempting to prejudge what a significant and persistent inconsistencies are. So our preference is option two for the process in relation to inconsistencies. However, parties should be able to correct the inconsistencies identified in the agreed electronic format. So we would like to engage with paragraph 53 and refine the text there also the options under these sections. Must not introduce new definitions and terms that do not exist under the article 13 review or the Paris Agreement in its entirety. Reviews have been underway for a long time, and this is not a new practice, so we shouldn't be reinventing the wheel. This also applies to the guidance that we have when we're providing for the Article Six technical expert reviews, we know for their work is to maintain consistencies and needs and that needs to be maintained in the reporting of the parties, and that we need to, that they need to conduct the work in alignment with the with the guidance that we have from COP 27 and we also are of the view that these discussions must remain around the process discussions purely not to attempt reopening or renegotiating, doing decisions or introducing new guidance that is not needed. Finally, we do trust and support the CO facilitators and their work to streamline the tax and finding a better way to navigate the draft tax that we have. We'll stop it here for now. Thank you.

Thank you very much, Madam co facilitator on sequencing, we still hear quite a bit of divergence and views from party on party's ability to submit their reporting pending review of previous reports. But given that we do have clear dates for these reports to be submitted, we're hopeful that this concern can be addressed in two ways, the first of which is the improvement of the upfront information provided. And we're working on this through the authorization section. And of course, we also know that this is provided through the initial report, and the second way is the efforts that we're working on now to transparently and publicly flag the status of the review and its findings so that parties can see what is occurring in the review process, while further strengthening transparency through the additional reporting expected at each deadline. In our view, the more information, the better. Right now, focusing on convergence instead of divergence, there is er seems to be agreement around the tagging or flagging of the status of the review and its findings publicly in the cart. And we appreciate the United Kingdom's efforts on this as well, we see the use of similar language across the text and SB 60, and we think that this can be merged into one section as they're currently spread throughout the text in slightly different formulations. So for example, we would see the categories being something along the lines of review, pending review completed with knowing consistencies identified, review completed with inconsistencies identified, and then information not available. We think these would apply to annual information in the database for the consistency check, but could also apply to tagging or flagging for the outcomes of the term for, for ease of reference of these statuses, noting, of course, that a full report underpins the technical expert review. Some potential, some potential divergence seems to remain around, persistent and significant, and perhaps these could be added to as options to the review completed inconsistencies, identified tag, and then you would add a plus, plus significant and or persistent, so that that is sort of one, one tag. We would also support the notion that we're hearing around significant inconsistency, considered in relation to the risk of double counting, where that it could be defined as such, we also hear some divergence on how to address inconsistencies once they have been notified or identified that. And you know what we could do about that that goes beyond our existing guidance. So, for example, we already have guidance on the term publishing reports on the carb and providing recommendations for how to address the inconsistencies if it's useful to recall that language so that parties are feel that comfort then, then we're comfortable with that. Of course, we also know that these can be addressed through a resubmission of the information. And we can, of course, be more specific about the timelines through which this would need to occur, so that there's no massive two year time lag between addressing these inconsistencies. And then lastly, just to address persistent inconsistencies and implications of non responsiveness, we're also supportive of calls that we've heard in the room to language that recalls the article 15 implementation Compliance Committee For these instances. Thanks.

I thank you for facilitators and Secretariats on sequencing. Regarding sequencing, it is important for us to refer back to Sham Review Guidance, particularly part 24 and 25 the timelines for reporting and reviewing are already clarified there. We should adhere to these timelines to ensure transparency in cooperative approach, and we may further enhance transparency through reporting or reviewing, including identifying and addressing inconsistencies and the correction so simply saying sequencing and inconsistency are two sides of the same coin as we negotiating on how inconsistencies should be identified, notified and corrected, it will be also important for us to continue deepening these discussions at the same time. With that in mind, it will be more constructive to better discussion on SBI. Text, part 4344 and 47 that possibly enhance transparency in line with the speech of Sham guidance, Sham Review Guidance, the process by part 43 enables clear recognition of the status of reporting or reviewing. Part 44 reminds parties of the timeline. Part 47 encourages parties to submit initial report prior general information. Also these three paragraphs can be emerged instead of discussing separately as an entire facilitation to promote transparency regarding the bracketed part in part 43 in progress is more suitable than pending, because in progress has More positive indications that facilitates a proactive engagement by the parties to finalize our review process. In line, again, in line with Review Guidance on review practice guide on sorry, on inconsistency, firstly on review practice guidance section eight, first one, first options, inconsistencies, identifications. Again, we need to be minded that the Review Guidance on in Sham decisions already outlined the principles of review process. It is essential for us to focus on implementing these items with that in mind for review practice guidance, for example, para 58 we have to be clear that there is not a regulatory basis Interview guidance that requests expert review team to review consistency between methodologies using cooperative approach under 62 6.2 and methodologies used in the 6.4 mechanism. We've agreed in Paris that 6.2 a variety of is a variety of range of cooperative approaches, methodologies of 6.4 is, of course, very important. But 6.2 is not only the methodologies of 6.4 by nature. So it's not a matter of substance on the issue of identification, of inconsistency, and also recommended actions. So covering, covering from 62, to 64 of the text, overall, I think we can cope with it, because they are essentially in line with part 24 and 25 of Sharm El guidance. As for persistency of inconsistency, it is important, again for us to encourage the response to address inconsistency in an effective manner. As for significance of inconsistency, the distinction referred in part 64 according to the nature and and the extent of inconsistency, can help us understand the significance of inconsistency. However, I have to point out that the language used here needs to be elaborated. For example, the word impede in b2 is a bit discouraging, discouraging and should be changed again. Shangri guidance requests the review and parties to improve so and also pass from past 62 to 64 they can be incorporated to facilitate the process as a whole, rather than separating identification and recommendation in a separate manner. Thank you.

these sections, and apologize I want to be thorough. Given the time to not have to come back in on sequencing, we would support paragraph 43 including the text in brackets also paragraph 44 option A we to see 47 being useful. There's a clear annual deadline for AEF submission once a party's specified first transfer occurs, for example, by April 15, after the mitigation outcomes are canceled in an underlying system, it would be odd to require a party to ignore the requirement to report this first transferred amount to the articles database and then to apply corresponding adjustments, potentially later that year, a stronger encouragement than what's in paragraph 47 could be to submit the initial report in a timely manner that allows the publication of the final report from the technical expert review prior To the next deadline for submitting an AF. Of course, the submission for an initial of an initial report is required for submitting an AF that's related to that initial report and the authorization that triggered it, but we don't want to intentionally discourage parties ignoring other mandatory timelines for accounting. We don't see 48 or 49 being appropriate, but on 49 wonder if parties would be amenable to prominently flagging sustained inconsistencies where ITMOs are used in BT ers that contain information on the end year of the NDC implementation period. For example, if the six two reviews final report were to contain a top line summary finding that the Article Six turn from the Article Six chair that highlights specific persistent inconsistencies that pose a risk of double counting. For example, calling out to the summary of the findings from the terror in narrative and tabular format, as there are high level tables at the top of those reports indicate the Summarized findings that these shall include findings from the terror that there are inconsistencies that present a risk of double counting in the application of corresponding adjustments. We are very open to a transparency based approach here. We would not be open to proposals elsewhere to block transfers. We would support paragraphs 50 and 51 on identifying and notifying inconsistencies, also 52 option one, both A and B are acceptable to us when it comes to notation, we can also work with option one under responses to and publication of identified inconsistencies regarding notation on the status and the findings from initial reports for all notation recommendations, though, we would advise distinguishing the status of review of the internal consistency of the information within or across a party's own reports, distinguishing that from systemic issues. So looking at the systemic consistency of the report, which is between a party's reports and other participating parties reports, a party that submits afoul support of any kind should not be fully penalized for for the inconsistencies in a participating party's report. We know there are issues, but we also need to recognize what reporting is done. Well, we agree with Canada's comments on option one under Section eight in the paragraphs that follow in the section, we're uncomfortable with trying to define significance at this stage in all parties experience with six two guidance, also because the bike itself has not yet defined this charm, we prefer to clearly define inconsistencies, what we mean by that and what's meant by persistence, which is far more straightforward and fair comparable. It seems challenging to distinguish materiality here. We think it would be additive to existing guidance to explain what an inconsistency is, categorically and with a focus on critical inconsistencies, we, I guess, refer to it as informally and the dedicated consequences for those, we see these falling into four categories, any omission of information in relation to a mandatory reporting requirement, whether that's quantitative or qualitative in any report or the Article Six database. Second would be clearly contradictory or conflicting information in initial reports or in regular information, and that can be considered across party reports. Third is inconsistencies in quantitative information. And here there are two cases. The first one is inaccurate application of the guidance on corresponding adjustments so the math that can only be found in annual information that's submitted by annually. The second case is an accuracy in annual information, which could involve amounts. It can also be an issue with descriptive information that is attached to those amounts. For example, if two parties were to report the same number, where it's first transferred and it's acquired, but the link between that amount to types involves two slightly different types. May be a clerical error. It may be a misunderstanding of the scale of the activity. That's what the recheck and the consistency check in the Article Six database should be able to identify our sort of fourth case of critical inconsistencies would be those that are persistent in any of these cases where there is no resolution within defined time frames. But we can't just keep saying by the next reporting period without specifying what that means, because we actually have multiple reporting periods in this guidance, we think parties should provide guidance to the Secretariat on the time frames for determining persistence to inform their preparation of the annual synthesis of the results of technical expert reviews, which are published on the carp they are considered by the CMA annually. This report is described in paragraph 13 of both two CMA three and six, CMA four, for annual information where inconsistencies are identified in the consistency check in the database, we would suggest that any inconsistencies that are not corrected prior to the next deadline for the submission of annual information would be persistent. Whether that's information that is submitted annually or biennially, you would need to submit that information twice in order to know this. But you would know this after the completion after the consistency check, and if a party does not resubmit information to resolve that inconsistency a second time for initial reports and regular information, we would see inconsistencies needing to be resolved before the next review of that same information. But here again, you need a second technical expert review to identify whether the recommendations from the first one have been addressed. So we would suggest the inconsistencies that are identified and where recommendations are made from a review that these should be resolved prior to the next submission of that same information or anything that is not resolved prior to the publication of that second final report is deemed persistent. Thank you.

On sequencing and timing. We think it's useful here to include language clarifying that an initial report or updated initial report shall be submitted prior to or in conjunction with annual information, either in the AF or regular information on corresponding ITMOs. We've heard from others and agree that notations on the status of the review report should be made on annual information displayed in the carp. We've heard some helpful suggestions on this text being better located in chapter eight, under the section responses to and publication of to identified inconsistencies, and we agree with that on inconsistent inconsistencies, broadly on inconsistencies. We agree with Canada that there are ways the text can be streamlined and reorganized to avoid confusing the two consistency or inconsistency processes that we've been talking about on chapter seven, like others, we think it's useful to have a way to flag inconsistencies in annual information through the labeling process. We see outlined in option b1 in chapter eight on the identification of inconsistencies, we would see it important that the status of the review of the initial report be made publicly available on the cop, as we see proposed in that strange paragraph three that comes under paragraph 66 we do have some so On the question of significant and persistent we do have concerns with unintentional impacts for the pake for its interpretation of significant and persistent inconsistencies, if we were to define these either for the annual information in The AF or in the review of the initial report. And we also worry that attempting to define an exhaustive list would be difficult, and we may unintentionally miss some instances which, for a reviewer, would be seen as particularly notable. So as such, we would prefer guidance that leaves the determination of significant or persistent up to the discretion of reviewers, as we see in paragraph 69 we do think, though, that some of the suggestions we've just heard from the US on a creative way to try to determine types of inconsistencies, without defining significant or persistent, are helpful and just coming in on special circumstances. We haven't heard very many interventions on this, but we did want to make a comment here so we don't think we've heard a persuasive argument why this matter needs to be considered every year. And so our preference is for option two, which would allow us to continue consideration of special circumstances in 2028 in line with the review of guidance. But to be clear, we're not opposed to considering particular issues if they arise before 2028 and we're open to language that would provide flexibility for this. Thank you.

Thank you so much, Maria and thanks colleagues for again, think a very constructive discussion on sequencing. It has been our view, and still is, that the triggers for reporting information have been decided, but we we do here in this room that there's a lot of convergence around making absolutely clear what the status is, making that clear transparently and publicly available on the card. So that is promising on when it comes to the classification of inconsistencies we we do believe that we should not over complicate this matter here, given the limited time, the focus of the terms that we want to give to the inconsistencies should be limited to significant and persistent. We have heard suggestions in the room which resonate with us, that significant could be related, defined as being related to the risk of double counting, but also looking forward to working on further guidance on this, beyond that the other terms, material, data, and so on and so forth. We, we do not think that this is, this is something at this stage that we will be able to finish if we want to get done by by Saturday and so call on parties to stick to the terms that have been in the review guidance that we adopted. If significant and persistent inconsistencies are identified, then absolutely there has to be the link to the pike. And we're also open to exploring other implications, recalling very much that the point must be to give parties a chance to make a better submission and resubmit and try and address these so that's what we're aiming at, and we have to get these incentives right. Thank you so much.

the issue of sequencing and timing, Our preference would be option two, paragraph 47 and I won't elaborate much on the issue to save the time as for the process of identification of inconsistencies, Our preference would be to have a clear labeling of different statuses so we are flexible to work with either option A or b1 and the inconsistencies identified in other Catholics technical expert review. Well, our understanding of the objective of our discussions right now is that the instructions for the technical expert review team was a gradient chart text, and we do not really need any additional details on the process. So we do not really need see the necessity to include the whole process related issues, as suggested in option one. So we would go for option two here. We quite share the understanding of the significance of inconsistent as having some implications for double counting, and we would support the approach to proceed from this perspective on the introductions of some new concepts. Well, originally, we were in favor of thinking about any kind of material inconsistencies or other definitions. But right now we are concerned about the process of negotiating those new notions, so we would prefer to be cautious about this. And if we do need some new concepts, we need to elaborate proper and understandable definitions of those we support the label and all the status and the outcomes of the review, and we would clearly support certain clear timelines and the opportunity for the parties to correct the inconsistencies that were identified. Thank you.

Thank you, Madam copes, up there for sequencing and timing, our preferred option is the one with no tax on the EF submission. So option two and for process of identifying, notifying and correcting inconsistencies, we deem that power 53 is enough for correcting inconsistencies with some streamlining, and therefore there is no, we don't see any text required for Section Eight, therefore, and we are open to hearing On bridging proposals ensuring systematic integrity on an unburdens manner.

Thank you our group, United States. No All right. Thank you for your flexibility with that, colleagues. I see no further flags for the third cluster. And so if we could move on from Section nine to discuss 1011, 12, I predict the conversation on registries is going to be extremely brief, because the abridge is there, right? Not the most contentious issue it all. So floor is open for sections, 1011, and 12, and we have an hour and five minutes left you. I will also like to remind that we are not asking for a restatement of positions with regards to these sections, we are asking for whether or not you are willing to be flexible on an option that you had previously supported in the text, whether there is a bridging proposal that you would like to include in the next iteration of text in order for it to be more widely shopped, or if you would like to support some other option that is not directly yours, so please don't repeat your positions. In the interest of time, we have Japan and then the EU Japan.

Thank you very much. On registry, the main discussion point here is to what extent an international registry should provide a function for parties that do not have their own registry and and connection and interoperability between each party's registry, international registry, and for four point 6.4, mechanism registry, to think of what essentially registry is, let us be reminded of the most important paragraph, 29 and 30 of Glasgow guidance, the law of registry is clearly defined there in summary, registries, including participating parties, registries, sections comprised in the international registry for the purpose of tracking record parties actions related to ITMOs that are authorized to ensure environmental integrity. In line with this role, our discussion in this part, should focus on recording and tracking of ITMOs through registries. On that each party's registry, international registry and mechanism registry will be connected to each other on voluntary basis, to prevent view of ITMOs between international registry and participating parties registry, and also put on the view of ITMOs between four 6.4 mechanism registry and international registry. And also enable transfer of authorized sorry, and on that ITMOs are uniquely decoded and traceable by the parties. It allows all the ITMOs in different registry to be summarized and be reported, and which means all the necessary reporting in line with Article Six, guidance can be implemented through registries. In order to operationalize what I explained on functionalities and interoperability of registries, we think we can add a few texts in this, in the decision in this cop, firstly on, on the connection between participating party registry and international registry. They are quite they are already defined in the previous decisions in Glasgow and sham. So we can perhaps recall them and and for the connection between 6.4 mechanism registry and 6.2 participating party registry. We can decide in this scope, in the CMA, and we can this, we can base para 33 of SB, text on 6.4 not on 6.2 para 33 in. SB, text, SB, 60, text on 6.4 we think that this can be a basis. And, for 6.4 mechanism, registry and international registry connection, we can elaborate based on the power 79, of x SB 60 text on 6.2 not 6.4 and also in relation to the underlying cooperative approach registry, which being referred in the footnote of AF At charm, we can, perhaps we can add a new tech, new paragraph, elaborating on the connection between the underlying cooperative approach registry and party participating party section in International registry, for the for the sake of putting a viewing of ITMOs, also in order to facilitate the reporting and viewing under mechanism under registries, registries, we think we may want to encourage the parties and international organizations to enhance international support for capacity building, including infrastructure and operation of the party of the registries, because in part 18 of of Sham annex two, there is a reference to clarify that the operation itself of the registries or the responsibility of the parties I stop here. Thank you. Sorry. We are preparing to take exact text to articulate what we have what I've explained. So looking forward to further engagement with those who are interested. Thank you.

And we know that there are a range of positions on the issue of registries, and I we have not put out any text on that, because, to be honest, we're struggling. To know where the where a landing ground might lie. But I just wanted to reflect a little bit on a couple of issues. I think many of us left charm thinking we agreed something, all of us, and then discovered that our understanding was different. And if we're honest with ourselves, I think the sham text has a bit of tidying needed. It's a bit of a tangled web that we have weaved, and I've got a range of analogies here. I do think for us to get through this, and you'll forgive the intervention, we have many flavors of authorization throughout this text. It's like Baskin Robbins ice cream, and we have a discussion on whether there's one or three. But I do think we need to tie up, or just have tie up, our different understandings of authorization and how they fit together. And I think we also have issues around the triggers of where and when they happen, the triggers for accounting will first transfer, essentially when and where they happen, which is related to the design of the AF and the registry. And I do think for us to get out of here, it's actually quite a technical job to try and link all these things up and have a clear understanding. And I know at least one of you is an engineer up there a flow diagram that would help us work through it. I think this system for it to fit together, and maybe the registry solution requires a bit of that, but no solution at present, and I'm sorry for that, but we will find one. I do think we've got a couple of things to say about the rest of the document, if we can one, one is that I think we do see a role for work programs going forward. I've heard worries that if we continue a work program, there will be uncertainty. Now the shape of those work programs depend on whether we resolve some issues up front and upfront information and in consequences, but we would retain the work programs for the moment. Paragraphs 8182 and 83 we do think it would be useful to clarify with respect to the biennial report in paragraph 22 of the Glasgow decision, because it's essentially a repeat of the initial report, that that report is is not just a repeat of the initial report, but that it's actually a report on the implementation of the features of the initial report, and it should try to both reflect on individual cooperation, but also on cumulative cooperation, because it's a catch up. So we think there's some clarification that we might do with respect to paragraph 22 of the BTR. And we also think it would be worth clarifying what the Secretariat reports on. And we have a paragraph essentially requiring the Secretariat to report to the substa a summary of inconsistencies identified and recommendations of the technical expert review, because it would be important for this body to consider the system as a whole and whether further guidance is needed to address it. Thank you.

yes, you're right. We are half almost well in AILAC position, we see that there is a really big importance on making a difference between the different functions that we see, or the different connections that we see the international registry having with other kinds of registries, or the six four or the party registry, and so on a every connection has a different implication. And also we believe that some of those connections were really decided and has some clarity in other and previous decisions. However, having into account the conversations that we have had here, we as AILAC, have also been working in a text of registries in order to have a or to find a middle ground on this topic, a on the first one, which is the relation between the 6.4 mechanism and the International registry. And this is something that we also said yesterday in the room for 6.4 and it is that we believe that the authorized units, which are the 6.4 ers, can go into international registry because they are already authorized, and they can go into international registry. And that's and that's because pattern 29 states that the international Registry, or the national registry as well, it should be able to track and record the authorizations for transfer and transfer and so on. What para 29 and we all know what it says. So it means that if you already have authorized a 6.4 er that will become later on in an ITMO, that 6.4 er that was authorized can flow into international registry because you have to capture the authorization step. So that's one clarification that we also wanted to to make a and that's something that we would also like to see in the text, and that's also in our proposal text. And then it comes the other relation, which is the relation between the international registry and the National registries, or other registries that are a related to the replacement of the National Registry, because the party doesn't have the national registry. So if it's for these two with all we also believe that that was already described in previous decision in which the information can flow from one to the other, having into account that we know that the international registry have to record and track authorization transfers, transfer and so on. We do believe there could be some kind of clarification, and that's also a clarification that we could be a giving as well as as the substance, CMA, a we also have that written down, and then on the case of the that the national registry is replaced by another registry, which we have been lately, calling it the underlying registry, which can come from the private sector. We also believe that relation can exist a in the case of the units that have been authorized to become ITMOs. But for that information to flow, there should be some kind of a statement or authorization or a figure that states that the party is authorizing. Sorry for using the word authorizing, but I'm not finding any other word right now, a authorizing that registry to, let's say, approved, because Maria is now laughing on the podium, it's approving the use of that underlying registry to pass the information into their account In the International registry as a unit that was authorized to later on become officially an ITMO after being transferred a that clarification as well, we see that can could also be done a we have also revised Japan's A proposal. We don't completely agree with all of this it, but we are working with together with them as well, to see how that can be further clarified in the way it is written down. And with that, I would like to finish.

Thank you very much, AILAC. And indeed, I was laughing, because I think parties couldn't find a way to say authorization other than authorization within the texts from Glasgow and here we are. So you know Singapore. Thank

you, madam COVID. Since theater and Good afternoon colleagues, just wanted to focus as well on Section 10, and I think this is the one section in the text, and we're certainly not advocating for very significant new additions to the entirety of the draft text. But I think this section in particular, we felt the language and the options here don't necessarily fully capture the discussions that the room has been having. I think we recall some of the discussions that we had at the hybrid workshops on Article Six two and six four, the current options in the text speak very much to discussions around interoperability between the six two international registry and the six four mechanism registry. But I think, as alluded to by colleagues who spoke before me, that there are other conversations around the additional functionalities for the six two international registry, whether there were differing views in the room about what was agreed under paragraphs 29 and 30 in Glasgow. And moving forward, you know what additional functionalities the 62 international registry should have beyond Poland view, what it really means under paragraph 29 for the six two international registry to track and record the different functionalities that were laid out in Glasgow as well. So we understand that as alluded to as well, there are a number of bridging proposals on the floor, but I think this is the one section in the text that we would just want to seek the CO facilitators indulgence to consider some of the bridging proposals that will be submitted by the different groups and to see how additional options on the six two international registry and its additional functionalities could be populated in Section 10. Thank you.

Thank you. Council facilitator on the first registry question we had to answer just to take stock our understanding as parties in the room are comfortable with the concept that authorized six four ers can move from the six four mechanism registry to a participating party registry if that party chooses to do so, and the appropriate registry communication protocols are in place. So a way to partially streamline some of the texts as well. I wonder if we could keep paragraph 77 which I just referred to, and also consolidate paragraph 7476 and 78 which for older doing seeking to achieve quite similar things by recalling past text on the second registry question, we recognize this is the more challenging one for parties to find a convergence on seeking to clarify that six four ers can be transferred and held in accounts in the six two International registry, as well as people, and viewed, if parties choose to do so, our view of past decision texts, particularly in relation to interoperability references, such as the transfer of it most from six CMA four means that parties that use the international registry should not be constrained to using an underlying registry only they may do This, but this is no means a constraint, and the International registry can also enable the transactional approach if the party decides to utilize that function. The Secretariat has already helpfully confirmed that both these approaches can functionally coexist in a coherent manner. And this option, of course, provides parity to users of the International registry with other participating parties that have their own registry with respect to Article Six registry actions only, which I think we've here to call for as well. And finally, for those with concerns in relation to environmental integrity, I think it's helpful to remind ourselves that we've already got past decision texts that says that the users of the International registry are responsible for tracking the underlying mitigation activities and mitigation outcomes and to ensure the avoidance of double counting. So to help alleviate some of those concerns, it could be helpful to recall this paragraph 18, from six, CMA, four, annex 1c, and of course, and I think we should all be cognizant of the other reporting guidance that we have that can help facilitate high transparency of underlying mitigation activities. Thank you.

We had the extensive discussions here in Baku last month on registry in relation to 6.2 and 6.4 and in the current text and those mainly were concentrated on party that have not registry and wanted to use the international registry as their national registry, and the functions that are needed, and All of that is not in the current tax.

those party will use the international registry just having pulling and viewing, or they can have transactions within the international Registry, or they can issue. That was the discussion we had. And whether, in this international registry, those party will manage only ITMOs or mitigation out, or mitigation outcome and ITMOs. And I think if we come back to those discussions and try to have a consensus that will clearly define the function that are needed, and the linkage with 6.4 and that international registry, as well as national registries, or all the underlining registries and that international registry, because as a party without a registry, if I want to use the international registry as my national registry, I wanted some linkage with 6.4 What I wanted the 6.4 to provide in my account, within the international registry, I may also have bilateral agreements. I can use the independent standards and all those I wanted those to come into the international registry, in my account to perform functions as a national registry. All of that need to be taken into account, and what limit only ITMOs in Bose and mitigation outcomes and all of that. If we define that, I think it will be better. It will be easier to define the interconnection between the 6.4 and the International registry, as well as the underlining registry, national registries with the International Thank you.

Thank you, co facilitator. So on registries, we seem to be dealing with some easier aspects which we relate to, inter operability, and the ones referring to additional functionality from functionalities which seem to be the crunchiest of all issues, and largely due to the facts that we're discussing legal text under persistent and significant divergences with regard to what was agreed in Glasgow, as well as conceptual disagreements around the very nature of this international registry. So maybe it's helpful to take a step back and see what we're looking for here. We would like to recall a few elements that would be useful to guide us through the informal talks that we need. Firstly, that Article 6.2 is not a mechanism. It does not have standards or procedures on how to generate mitigation outcomes. It does not have supervision. That's 6.4 right? So 6.2 is an instrument that aims at ensuring transparency to the transfer of mitigation outcomes, and as such, its registry must contain all the information necessary to allow for whoever wants to do it, to assess the integrity of that cooperative approach, both of the mitigation outcomes, generation and transaction we must be able to know how the cooperation allowed for the reduction of or removals of GHG emissions, and how that was accounted for in the party's inventory. Now, at some point, it was decided that a party needs to have or have access to a registry in order to participate in 6.2 clearly created a potential problem, because some countries have while others have not their national registries. And to solve this, it has been decided that the international registry would serve as a registry for those who do not have one. We all know that. So in this sense, this registry must be understood as an enabling infrastructure, not as policy. In our view, it is essential that all parties who want to participate in cooperative approaches under Article 6.2 are able to do so so without diving into technical considerations about the very nature of an ITMO, is it a quantity, a unit, an asset, just information, the International registry should provide countries that need it with the infrastructure necessary for them to cooperate. EU, to cooperate, even if in an entering basis while a simultaneous capacity building program is offered to build that country's own national registry, as suggested by Japan, as long as they can provide the underlying information on how the mitigation outcome was generated, they should have access to infrastructure to perform the needed transactions, so this could be taken into account while discussing additional functionalities as well as the needed caveats and clauses and protection language that would address some legitimate concerns raised by others. In this sense, we are happy to work with a proposal made, made by Japan, hopefully around the diagram before we tackle the legal text that should translate it into reality and look for a technical way to address these difficulties based on what we do agree on, that's it.

coppo, Senator, for giving me the floor. Would you agree with many who have expressed that discussion of the registries is quite technical and it's quite contentious, and finding resolution would help us reach an agreement here in COP 29 and we do agree with many who have mentioned that the international registry should be used for those who don't have a national registry or do not have access to national registry, but we do have A couple of concerns that we would like to address and hopefully find a way to resolve them. The first being is that the guidance that we have for Article 6.2 is a guidance for tracking and recording, and as such, we had the expectation of the guidance that we have said the international registry would have the functionalities of pulling and viewing that is aligned with the guidance that we have for 6.2 but we do understand this on Tim it that some parties need access to a national registry that would give them all of the functionalities that they need. For example, we heard that there is a need to have an issuance function in the international registry. But we do wonder that if we do add this insurance function to the international registry, would we have the concern that this would transfer the liability from the parties to the to the UN registry, to the international registry, which we cannot allow to happen, the responsibilities for the ITMOs and for the units that are being issued And the environmental integrity should lie with the participating parties. Another issue is we do have guidance on what are the functionalities that we need for both the international registries and the minimum requirements for the National registries. But here, when we're talking about the international registries and the functionalities, we are setting an international standards of how registry should behave. So if we do add additional requirements that are not necessarily required for national registries, we might be imposing additional requirements on a national levels for those parties, for other parties who are not using the international registry as a national registry. However, most importantly, the agreement that we had when we were discussing the registries and cop 26 is that we had an understanding that when engaging in cooperative approaches, that parties who don't have resources, who do not have capacities, who do not have the ability or access to a national registries, the participating party should be able to give them that access. Should be able to help them develop their own national registries, or give them access to that. And we feel like this conversation is that is happening right now. Is transferring? Is that transferring the responsibility from the participating parties to provide this access to the other parties in their cooperation to the to a UN registry, and that is not the agreement or the understanding that we had from COP 26 and then we understand that there needs to be, and the guidance that we have talks about having a transfer of the 6.4 ers to the international registries, and we do look forward to having a discussion on how can that happen without changing the nature of the International registry that we have from the existing guidance, and then when we're talking about the work program, we do believe that it is too early at this point in time to have this discussion, because The elements that will be part of our work program, if any, that we will agree on, depends on the progress during these sessions. And for the final section we have we do not support paragraphs 8790 and 91 I'll stop here for now. Thank you.

Thank you very much. The International registry. I would just agree with some of the others that have just mentioned that, of course, the flavor of the text is such that that the core issues that folks are debating are not so clearly visible. So there is a need, I think, to Yeah, step back a bit, the International registry. It's a part of the Paris Agreement infrastructure that's very important to members of AOSIS, because parties should not be disadvantaged in participating in Article Six if they don't have a national registry. And we also need to start the international registry so countries can actually submit their initial reports, right? So postponing the discussion is not it's not going to help countries without a registry get started or even submit their initial reports. Many countries are resource constrained, and it's unreasonable to expect many small countries to develop their own registries. Article 62 is meant to help generate more ambition. So we need to enable all parties to engage. We've already agreed to establish an international registry. We've also already agreed that it's for use by parties that do not have or have access to a registry, so the parties that don't have one can, of course, use the international registry, but for the International registry to function as a national registry would it needs to have the full functionalities of a national registry. This includes the ability to record or reflect for the first time an ITMO that has been generated from a cooperative approach between two parties, and the ability to transfer, cancel, etc, that ITMO, this is a this is an equity issue. All parties need to be able to participate fully. Now, we understand from the secretariat that the international registry can be both transactional and also support polling and viewing, and we understand that there's interest in both approaches. Both approaches need to be available for parties that wish to use them. AOSIS cannot support just polling and viewing. We've all acknowledged in the context of interoperability of registries that parties may wish to transfer it so we need to support parties that do not have a national registry and transacting ITMOs as any party with a national registry. Could we hear concerns, certainly at the at the workshop, we hear concerns expressed about environmental integrity in connection with an issuance or generation function of the International registry, but parties should be able to engage in a cooperative approach and have the results of their cooperation reflected in units or amounts recorded in the international registry, if they wish, without having to go through an external program or an external registry to do so, the resulting ITMOs must be able to be captured in the international registry. This is a functionality that has to be available. And again, it's an issue of equity. Of course, some parties may want to rely on external registries. Have that information flow into the international registry or directly to the article six database. That's fine, but parties should not have to use an external registry to reflect the transfer in the international registry. The whole point is for countries to not have to establish a national registry if they do not want to or cannot. So you know, regarding sensitivity about you know, generation function, in our view, you know to the extent their environmental integrity concerns, the best way to address that is for more information, so that there's more confidence that Article Six, two requirements are met and that we understand fully, the the underlying cooperative approach. Yeah, there's a need, I think, for some some perhaps just, just core decision text. And we'll, we'll come forward with some that just really emphasizes the, the various functionalities that we've already agreed in paragraphs 2930 and then in our later guidance, paragraphs 910, and 23 regarding, again, the access to the international registry by parties that do not have or have access to a registry performing for them the functions of such registry, the functions we've already agreed and regarding interoperability, etc, but then emphasizing, again, really clearly that any party participating in the International registry will not need to participate in another registry, just just to engage in a cooperative approach. Like, why would we make our lives harder? And that this party can, in addition to recording any other ITMO actions that we've listed in paragraph 29 record transfers of ITMOs or amounts, if you if you care, to phrase it that way, from her to another party. We just need to have that functionality available for small countries to be able to play the game. Thank you.

thank you for the registry. We support flexibility here. Parties should have the option to choose their preferred register system model, as long as it meets the essential requirements and ensure transparency while preventing double counting. Therefore we support option one with the inclusion of necessary provisions on the interoperability between party registries and the mechanism registry. Thank you.

so we echo the comments made by the LMDC and several parties and groups that, as per the guidance that we have the international registry should serve to pull and view data on the authorized demos and authorized a 6.4 ers, we do not have any reservations on parties using the international registry for transactions of the mitigation outcomes, but we would like to reiterate here that the authorization and the process of changes and revocations of the authorization should remain the prerogative of the first transferring party only and agreeing with the LMDC stance. Once again, the ownership and responsibility of the mitigation outcomes should remain with the participating party rather than the international registry. We also agree with the sounds in the room that authorized a 6.4 ers may be transferred to the international registry.

thank you. We appreciate the chance to discuss this very important topic of parties, and we would agree with the several other interventions came before us about concerns about some of the current proposals, but also what seemed to be emerging alternatives or bridging proposals that have come through during our Workshop in Bucha and in discussions between parties on on registries. The United States considers that the functions of the International registry should not be less than the registries that are described in paragraph 29 we have agreed that it performs those functions specifically. But the question here is whether it should have more traditional functions compared to those registries, which we agreed were explicitly for the purpose of tracking and recording information, data records on party actions relating to ITMOs, starting with recording the amounts of mitigation outcomes that are first transferred and then the actions that follow. The party registries in paragraph 29 are interoperable for the purposes of transferring that information, data and records on party actions relating to ITMOs, including the amount associated with them. We elaborated this in charm, but those are distinct. That information, those records, that's distinct from units, and we know from experience in qui go protocol negotiations that this is a relevant distinction in this process. Historically, these words mean something we have not clarified, but we could that's the one thing that that is probably more of a record or a document than it is data is that that refers to authorizations in paragraph 29 we understand that to mean the copy of the first authorization of the use of ITMOs under a cooperative approach, which is submitted has required a paragraph ET g of Glasgow, and it sets off the application of 62 guidance, also the authorizations that come after that per paragraph 19, the authorization and any authorizations or communications to an underlying mechanism or regulator or other participating parties about the coverage and the conditions for mitigation outcomes to be accounted for by applying six to guidance. Once the authorization is published, we would consider it best practice to be within two weeks of publication, it should be submitted along with any additional information on the authorization and the initial report for the updated one, but we also see these copies of authorizations and any further information on them also being uploaded to the carp and being maintained in a party's registry that's referred to in paragraph 29 so necessarily also in the international registry. We struggle with the options in our current text, whether they pertain to transferring six four ers that are covered by an authorization to the six two international Registry, or where they involve moving or issuing any other units that are certified or issued to any other mechanism, or potentially not at all using another mechanism for those to be contained in this registry. On the question of six for ers, moving to the international registry, we hear this ask, primarily from host parties. But find this confusing, because the international registry does not have an account for holdings, including for a host party to hold mitigation outcomes that have not yet been internationally transferred. It might be covered by the scope and the conditions of an authorization, but until and unless they're internationally transferred, they are not ITMOs that's in the name, and there is no risk of double counting. There's no guidance that pertains to quantifying or describing or accounting for them. For those mitigation outcomes, call them units. I have not been internationally transferred. This would amount to a significant expansion of the scope of Article 62 guidance will speak to the implications of this in the agenda item addressing the six, four mechanism registry, which is where we see this question being resolved in text. Our concerns about the issuance for holding of mitigation outcomes for units in the six two international registry are similar when it comes to unitizing mitigation outcomes from any other mechanism, or in this case, from what we've heard, more likely, just from projects that are not using another mechanism and so would rely on the international registry. The registries that are referring to six student guidance shouldn't be confused with carbon market registries or understood to be equivalent to Kyoto Protocol registries that issue or hold or enable retirement of units or granting access to private entities to access those because Article Six two does not establish a mechanism or rules, modalities procedures would be necessary to credibly issue or reissue or otherwise create or hold tradable units with a distinct store of value that has no basis in an underlying carbon market system or a certification mechanism. We have some key concerns with this, starting with mandate, obviously, as I've just described, but there are also others timing in that it would involve an extensive work program to reconcile these missing elements with six two guidance. It would also mean that parties would need to reformulate whatever national arrangements they have put in place to encompass coverage of mitigation outcomes that are covered by an authorization capacity buildings associated with all of these systems on environmental integrity, we see this contradicting Global efforts, by parties, by stakeholders, by independent ratings agencies. What have you to build and promote the use of comprehensive, high integrity certification systems, whether those are national or multilateral or independent, because this would enable units to be issued based on short term arrangements between parties and single standalone methodologies, including those under the clean development mechanism, which may or may not be updated to reflect rules under this explore mechanism, but could presumably be used for issuing or otherwise creating units mitigation outcomes on the international registry. In other words, approaches to unit creation for parties that many parties here would never accept in private markets, the private markets themselves have largely left by we understand parties have concerns about independent mechanisms and their registries, but we would consider the absence of any crediting mechanism or registry to be the focus of our concerns and questions here. And then we see there being a limited market opportunity for host parties in that if this is the approach that's being taken for the mitigation outcomes in this registry system, those outcomes would only be usable toward an NDC in the same NDC time frame when they are created. And it would also mean that, because there's not a comprehensive mechanism that supported their creation, that they would not be able to access sustained demand for those activities where development or use of high integrity certification mechanisms, including national ones, not Just voluntary, that's a prerequisite. So there these generate stranded assets, effectively, for these parties, unless they then shift to revising some of their approaches in order to qualify under a mechanism after the end of an NDC time frame. Article Six, two is the only remaining prospect that we're aware of, where there's still demand for units from projects that are unsuborded by any certification mechanism.

We would suggest that there are alternatives. Some of these have been mentioned today. We hear concerns about the value of pulling and viewing but we've also heard from parties in our direct discussions with them and in Baku that they want to be able to directly track and the transfer and use of mitigation outcomes, or even those that have crossed the line into ITMO hood in an international registry in real time. And that would be extremely valuable, and that would mean enabling pulling and viewing from those external registry systems for the purposes of being able to track that information where it's relevant to a party. If the concern here is being able to avoid double counting, then that would helpfully address that there are also supporting systems for the development of national mechanisms and mechanism registries. Many parties are engaged in this already. The partnership for market implementation is one. There's there are dozens and dozens of examples of bilateral cooperation of the kind that is envisaged under six two, where the party is supported to develop these registry systems and also, importantly, the mechanisms for the units that are housed in them. To be clear, the US prefers not to reinvent the wheel or to suggest the best practice would be to proliferate a bunch of registries and mechanisms, if the country itself is willing to work with robust mechanisms, some of which are informed or even administered by individuals in the scientific and the market community that know how to build and administer such a system, can dedicate resources to that full time and ensure that it is insured with an eye to administer the outcomes that are issued there for potentially the decades that would be required for these registry services. We should not be putting that burden on national governments unless it's one that they're prepared to take on in some parties are so here, we would suggest that this maker decide to request the Secretariat in implementing the capacity building program we've adopted and including through regional collaboration centers, to assist parties, and particularly developing country parties, that are intending to participate in cooperative approaches in the identification and the implementation of software resources for party registries to perform mechanism registry functions if requested by a participating party in order to issue and transact mitigation outcomes as units under a national or bilateral mechanism. Thank you.

I'll be very short on registries, because I feel that we're not at the point of coming to a particular solution here. I would just note that if we're speaking about an international infrastructure of any kind, we should be mindful that it was intended to serve the parties who do not have, for some reasons, the opportunity to have their own infrastructure, and if we are aiming for the inclusive mechanisms and the global market that provides the opportunities for global action, then we should ensure that this kind of infrastructure addresses the needs, is practical and is technically available for everybody that is willing to participate in this. I'll stop here with the registry issue, and I will just shortly comment on the work program. We could share the understanding that probably it is too early for us to go into details on this section, because we haven't really reached any kind of significant progress on the issues that are at the table right now, but we would just note that We have serious questions about the necessity of paragraph 82 in the current draft text, and as I have said, the whole section,

Thank you Madam Chair. I can be brief simply with with respect to the international registry, first, we see two key functions. We see that and agree with AILAC and I ers that and others, that the international registry, with additional functionalities, contains all the functions required for participating parties who do not have access to a national registry, and it's important for LDCs, because we just don't have the enabling infrastructure to fulfill the participation requirements in Article Six. So that's one function of the International registry. Second, we need the international registry to pull and track transactions of all ITMOs and points, so we so we have some sort of overview mechanism so that we can see this is tracked, so we see there are two key functions of this international registry. Thank you.

thank you, Maria. Two points we would like to make. We fully support the intervention made by group sewer, meaning from the moment that we agreed that to participate on six, two, a party needs to have access to a registry. Is just equitable, that parties want to participate can access a registry. We believe that registry are national priority and that most definitely, they should not be using, or have to be using a third party registry to be able to engage that. Said, We also believe that the Secretariat would not have to build a gigantic machine of registry, etc. And so what would be the minimum to allow parties that require to participate, 6.2 would need. And that probably could be a balance to find there. Secondly, on the text here, we feel that could be misunderstood, that the mechanism registry could issue ITMO, and so we believe that actually ITMO again needs to be issued by 6.2 registry and also mitigation outcome six, four. Er needs to go through the process of ITMO on decision two, CMA three, and therefore we would like to see this clarified in the next iteration.

Thank you very much, Maria, okay, as you said, this is clearly one of the more controversial elements of our text, but I think it was Singapore who mentioned that there has been some progress since this text was developed in bond, and we're hopeful that this, this progress, can be reflected in the next iteration. I'm not going to call it a landing zone, I'm not going to call it a bridging proposal, but I'm going to call it progress. So I think one thing that is useful is perhaps to go back to first principles on the international registry recalling the international registries are for ITMOs, for internationally transferred mitigation outcomes, and that ITMOs need to be authorized and first transferred as per their their name and definition. We hear desires for services, not necessarily for ITMOs, but for mitigation outcomes. An example would be that not all mitigation outcomes that come from a cooperative approach are authorized. And even if they are authorized, not all mitigation outcomes from a cooperative approach might be first transferred so do all of these mitigation outcomes authorized, mitigation outcomes as well, also live on the international registry. If not, where do they live? And I would, I would recall they do not right. The International registry is for ITMOs. So again, mitigation outcomes that come from a cooperative approach, that are not authorized, do not live on the international registry. Mitigation outcomes that are authorized but haven't been first transferred are not ITMOs and therefore do not live on the international registry. So perhaps as a middle ground, we can agree that the mitigation outcomes from a cooperative approach, authorized or even not authorized, can live somewhere else, but this information can be pulled and viewed into the international registry so that parties can see and know the status of all of their mitigation from a cooperative approach in one place. But the international registry remains a space for ITMOs, once again authorized and first transferred. These are on the international registry and can be transferred, canceled, used and acquired. Now as a slight tangent, I hear the understanding that the international registry contains authorizations, but our understanding is that this is a record of the authorization, not the actual provision of the authorization for a mitigation outcome, especially one that has not yet been first transferred, but once first transferred, it's useful to see the record of the authorization that underpins that ITMO, and therefore that's why it's useful to have authorization reported in the international registry. This is also applicable to the six four central mechanism for a six four ers that are authorized but not yet first transferred, these are also not yet ITMOs. Once authorized, a six four ers are transferred. These can also live in the international registry and party registries. So in very quick summary, the services that apply to mitigation outcomes authorized or not from a cooperative approach can be provided by underlying registries, and this information can be pulled and viewed into the international registry for parties to keep track of all of it. But the services that apply to ITMOs mitigation outcomes, authorized and first transferred are provided by the International registry, and include authorization, first transfer, transfer, acquisition, cancelation, and use consistent exactly with paragraph 29 of the Glasgow text. We hope that this is potentially a middle ground understanding of the varying services and functionalities of the International registry. Thanks.

Thanks, Maria, good afternoon again, colleagues. I think, as I'll be brief, and I just wanted to iterate one point, I think that would that was that I haven't heard yet today, and hopefully can clarify some housekeeping in the text here. But I guess I just overarching, wanted to acknowledge that this is indeed one of the trickier areas of our text. I think, as we've heard today, that there still is quite a big divergence, but I think we are getting closer, and I appreciate the comments from Singapore and just mentioned now by by New Zealand that I'm not sure that the text captures some of the nuance that that has developed since our last meeting in June, and I'm hoping some of the bridging proposals, recognizing the one mentioned by by Japan and from from New Zealand, can help us towards where that landing ground might be. But the one thing I wanted to point out, I mean, looking at Section 10, all the paragraphs mentioned the international registry, of course, that's what this section is, is pertaining to, except for paragraph 77 which relates to the connection of participating party registries and the six, four mechanism registry Canada supports the the development of this connection. We spoke to that yesterday in this section on six four, but question why that belongs here in the six two guidance, specifically on the section on the international registry. So just again to lender support to I think that the contents of this, this specific paragraph, but wonder why it needs to be included in this, this text. And perhaps we can have some stream streamlining here on this specific section. Thank you.

Thank you so much, Maria and colleagues. This is a very frank and open discussion, and we we hear how everyone is trying to bridge this while acknowledging that there's such different visions on this matter. We want to thank group of sua for the very helpful principles, and I think for taking a step back this is this is helpful. Infrastructure is not policy. And when we do Article Six, two cooperation, it is always the parties that are behind it and have the responsibility for it. I think we can also reassure LMDC on that matter that there is no intention of transferring liabilities up somewhere to a UN system. Our text, as Singapore has noted and others does indeed, not necessarily frag not only what was discussed in Bonn, I think even in Bonn, it didn't reflect, but what the tracks of the matter here is, and it comes, of course, as so many have noted, to the additional functionalities we potentially see an opening, I think, in noting these interventions that we heard that, of course, ITMOs are first transferred, and at the same time we have the first transfer as one element in the shell guidance in paragraph 29 so wondering to what degree this, you know, Since we're debating, When can you come in first transfer is in? It is one of the things. So while debating issuance and all of these other elements, could that be the moment where we allow the transactional functionalities to happen? So parties have agreed on a corporation. They have their underlying arrangements. They will explain these in reporting guidance. And of course, it's authorized, and that will be the copy, as others have noted, but to allow that first transfer trigger for the transactional functionalities to start, and then to be able to move these units between accounts. We think, you know, maybe that is something that we can explore further and very happy to work with other parties. And finally, I think, as has been pointed out, 77 it's a bit of a funny placement here, and we recognize the links between, between the mechanism registry and our six two guidance, 6264 the one thing that's absolutely essential for our group is that we make sure that where there's no debate on transactional aspects in 6.4 that we enable these links to participating party registries where they wish So, and we leave it at that and be very happy to work informally on All these beautiful diagrams that people have alluded to to try and move this forward. Thank you so much.

Thank you very much, colleagues. We need to leave the room because there is an event in this room, so we have to be out of here at one o'clock sharp. So if I may ask ag and us to keep it very, very, very brief. AGM,

thank you and thank you, Maria and Theo, just to because I have heard many colleagues coming back on saying the international registry is pulling view. We are not at that stage, because we have already taken some decisions in CMA three about party that do not have international registry. And we said clearly, the Secretary shall implement international registry for participating party that do not have registry or access to the registry. And we clearly said the international registry shall be able to perform the functions in 29 that is the we are not talking about polling view. We are now at this functions that the internationally needs to be able to perform. And in those one we have authorization, first, transfer, transfer, acquisition, use. Uh, cancelation. We have all of that. So we are not talking about pulling and view. Now we are talking about this one. And I think the main issue is in the first transfer definition, we are talking in other parts about issuance, whether we consider issuance within that first transfer and in this international registry in that function or not, what will be the implication we as Agent are not pushing for issuance, because we will have many other implications, and that may be negative for the system itself. But in any case, we are open and we understand people that are pushing for having issuance in that because the definition we give two issuance to first transfer includes issuance. So we need to discuss that issue and see the implication and how we can sort out that issue. We are open to any proposal in that sense. Thank you.

Thank you, Madam co facilitator, for your indulgence. And let me come back, didn't I? We didn't speak to the last two sections in the text. So just wanted to weigh in quickly on those first one, section 11, our expectation coming into this session is that we can make recommendations to CMA resolve the concerns that parties raised or introduced in our charm work program, and with that, we can consider this program completed, notwithstanding the ongoing consideration of various reports from the secretariat that are already requested, the work program that's undertaken by the Secretariat, the capacity building work under The RSA forum, but we would see any remaining work program items from Glasgow being taken up in the review, which is potentially multi year and by now, is expected to commence just a few years from now. And those tasks to take up and review encompass the broad majority of contents in our existing guidance that has been developed over multiple years on other matters, we would not support retaining paragraphs 90 and 91 including because the secretary task paragraph 91 already occurs, and there are also existing processes for considering the other matters in these paragraphs, if issues arise. Thank you.

Thank you.

I could see that what you were commenting triggered aiosis. But I'd just like to note that there has already been an intervention on the work program and other matters where parties have indicated that they are not yet ready to discuss those and that they need to be discussed at a later date, and we really need to leave the room. So with your indulgence, I'd like to conclude the session, and with your permission, we can iterate the text tonight for your consideration, hopefully whenever it's published sometime tomorrow. So colleagues, thank you for your views and support and advancing our work without delay, and we've now completed our first read through our next informal consultation in Article 6.2 is scheduled for tomorrow, tomorrow, Thursday, 14th of November. Please check the CCTV for the specific timing and meeting room. Thank you very much. Meeting is adjourned. You
